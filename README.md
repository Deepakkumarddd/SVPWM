Implementation of SVPWM Technique & Carrier Base PWM Technique for 3-phase 2-level VSI

    ◦ Conducted an in-depth analysis of Space Vector Pulse Width Modulation (SV-PWM) and Carrier-Based PWM techniques for controlling switches of inverters, focusing on their impact on output voltage performance.
    ◦ Performed a comparative study using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to analyze and compare the harmonic distortion, efficiency, and output voltage quality of both PWM techniques.
